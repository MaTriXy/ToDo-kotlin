# Week #1 project: Kotlin on Android

This is the first project of the [52 weeks, 52 projects](https://aziflaj.github.io/52-weeks-52-projects/) challenge, showing the usage of [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) for building Android applications.

The application is build using only the Android Framework, with no other dependencies rather than Kotlin. I wrote the Content Provider, the Cursor Adapter, and the Activities all in Kotlin instead of Java. The only Java files are the default test files, created automatically by Android Studio
